# Overview

This example is part of [OpenSceneGraph cross-platform examples][osgcpe].

In this example we

* use `xxd` Unix utility to convert a binary resource (`box.osgt`) into C header file
* use generated C header file across all platforms to load box model with OpenSceneGraph

**Note**: the example assumes you have already passed [OpenSceneGraph cross-platform guide][osgcpg].
